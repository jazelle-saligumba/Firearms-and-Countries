Exploratory data analysis on guns and countries by playing with charts and graphs -- is there a correlation between GDP and guns per 100? How much is the United States an outlier? And other things. 
The world countries data is from a .csv, originally from Kaggle but is public domain.
The guns data is scraped from a Wikipedia table and translated as a dataframe.
